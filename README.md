# MIS_scoring
This repository contains the R script for calculating the MIS score described in Lammert &amp; Morys et al., 2021 (in submission) and two dummy data sets from our lab to illsutrate how the script works. For questions or suggestions regarding the script contact Mathis Lammert (lammert@cbs.mpg.de) or Hendrik Hartmann (hehartmann@cbs.mpg.de).
